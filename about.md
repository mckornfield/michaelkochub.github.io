Hi. My name is Michael Kochubeevsky and I'm a software engineer currently working at [Appian][appian]. I attended UVa where I majored in Computer Science, and minored in Chemistry. I live in [Nova][nova]. 

My intention for this site is to blog about stuff that interests me and random, unexpected things that I come across while working on projects, exploring documentation, and more or less stumbling through the web. Some of those experiences I will document in the form of my [posts](/), which I hope you will enjoy reading. ðŸ™‚

If you'd like to contribute an article, feel free to fork this repo and then submit a [pull request][pr]!

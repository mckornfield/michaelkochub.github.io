## Intro
RAM is acronym that stands for **Random Access Memory**. The "random" in RAM isn't like the "random" outcome of a die roll, however. In this case, it's better to think of it as the opposite of "sequential". To explain this distinction, let's suppose you're looking facedown at a carton of a dozen eggs. I will represent this as a 2 x 6 array, with each box representing an egg. I've numbered the boxes from left-to-right.

If I asked you for the sixth egg, you would just grab the egg at the box marked **6** and hand it to me. In other words, you **randomly access** the sixth egg. We typically perform random access when the circumstances allow it, since the seek time (the time required to retrieve the requested item) is shorter than that of sequential access. If you were to access the sixth egg sequentially, it would look quite silly:

On the other hand, if I pointed to a stack of dozen books and requested the second book from the bottom, you would **sequentially access** that book. In this situation, it is not practical to use random access (unless you want to risk toppling the stack). You need to remove the topmost nine books to get to the second book from the bottom.

## Back to computers...

"Memory" is interchangeable with RAM. Yes, sometimes memory can be used to refer to your hard drive (or whatever type of secondary storage your machine uses), but that practice is rare and generally discouraged. Any programs running on your machine, as well as any data those programs use, are in RAM. When I check the hardware specs of my computer (a Mac), I see that it has 8 GB of memory. For the purposes of the example I'm about to do though, that much memory is a bit excessive. Let's scale things down a bit...

Suppose I have a very simple computer. It has exactly 1.5 B of memory, or 12 bits. That's a little over [1 byte](http://i.imgur.com/qIUb1.jpg) This is exactly like the egg carton example above. Since a bit may only take the value of 0 or 1, we will let the absence of an egg correspond to a 0, and the presence of an egg a 1.

This basic computer also has a very simple processor that supports a very simple language, which I will call `klang`. In this language, I can do three things:

1. Name a variable (`a`)
2. Select a target address (`@address`)
3. Write a value (`0`)
4. Get a value (`get a`)

Collectively, then, each statement may write a value, denoted by a variable, to an address _or_ retrieve a value, at an address, denoted by a variable. Let's start with the following example:

{% highlight text linenos %}
a@3 = 1;
b@7 = 1;
c@8 = 0;
{% endhighlight %}

The first statement names a variable `a`, specifies a location (`3`), and the value to store. In other words, the statement tells us to add an egg to box 3. Later, when we want to check if there is an egg at box 3 in the egg carton, all we need to represent that entire query is `a`. You should be able describe what the other statements do. Here's what our memory carton looks like now, after the three lines have been executed by our processor:

![eggs-ram](/assets/2016-12-03/eggs-ram.png)

Remember that a 0 means "no egg", and a 1 means "egg". The code above represents a **write**; that is, when I am adding or removing eggs to the carton. If I want to know whether there exists an egg at box 5, that is a **read**.


## No really, back to computers now...

Computers in the real world expand on the capabilities of our basic egg machine outlined in the preceding section. Real computers don't restrict you to assign values of 0 or 1, and they also don't require you to specify a memory address (or a location) when you want to assign a variable. We'll use the programming language C to you tell our computer to assign a value to a variable. The statement is pretty similar to the one we used in our egg language.

{% highlight C linenos %}
int a = 21;
{% endhighlight %}

What's going on here? Let's step through what a real machine does when it sees this statement:

1. Define a variable `a`
2. Assign the value 21 to `a`

Behind the scenes, as we saw with the egg machine, this computer stores the value of 21 in an arbitrary location in memory (RAM). Now let's retrieve this value, using the variable:

{% highlight C linenos %}
printf("The value is %d.", a);
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, we are reading the memory location of wherever the system decided to store our value, and printing the value to the console. You don't need to worry about the function call `printf()`. It's important to note that this value is accessed **randomly**. The machine does not look through its memory, byte by byte, to get to wherever `a` is. It goes directly. 

At this point, you might be wondering whether we can print the address of value. During the simple egg machine days, when we could look at the entire memory at once--all one and half glorious bytes--it was easy to check where a value was stored. In the real-life example, where RAM is measured in GB (1 GB is about a billion bytes), things aren't so simple. Thankfully, we have the option to call the address-of operator on our variable, which returns the memory location of the variable. Now, we can find out where exactly our cherished `21` is RAM! That is, if we do away with the concept of [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory). 

If I compile and execute the following program on my machine:

{% highlight C linenos %}
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a = 21;
	printf("Address of a is %u\n", &a);

	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I'll get this result in the console:

![addr](/assets/2016-12-03/address.png)

What's cool to note is that the address that is returned each time I executed the program is different. Clearly, the machine chooses a different place to store the value 21 for each run of the program.

## And what about SAM?

As the title of this post implies, I also promised to discuss sequential access memory. You'll be surprised to know that this is also a [thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_access_memory). There are various reasons for reading items in sequence, but there do exist machines that use SAM.
